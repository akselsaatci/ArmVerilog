# Single Cycle Arm Verilog
![alt text](https://github.com/akselsaatci/ArmVerilog/blob/main/single_cycle_arm.png?raw=true)
- I tried implementing this single cycle arm architecture in Verilog. 

- There are some mistakes but currently alu opeartions (ADD, SUB, OR, AND), Branch operations and data processing operations are mostly working.
- Currently there are no conditional logic so currently there are no support for conditional instructions.

- These are the truth tables that i implemented for control unit.
